    <h1>Getting Started</h1>

    <p>In this short tutorial, we will explain how to submit your first bot and get your name on the Halite leaderboard.</p>

    <h3>Register using Github</h3>

    <p>You will need a Github account in order to participate. If you don't have a Github account, please create a
        new account <a href="https://github.com/join">here</a>. Sign up for Halite by clicking "Sign in with Github" at the top right of this
        page.</p>

    <h3>Download a Starter Package</h3>

    <p>Download a starter package for your language of choice from <a href="https://github.com/nmalaguti/halite-starter/releases">Halite Starter Release</a>.</p>

    <p>Each starter package consists of a zip file that includes: (a) one code template for your your first bot (the MyBot file), (b) one
        code sample for a random bot (the RandomBot file), (c) some support libraries for the bot and (d) some tools to test your bot
        locally.</p>

    <h3>Getting on the Leaderboard</h3>

    <p>To get on the leaderboard, you need to submit a bot to the Halite tournament.</p>
    <p>Click the "<a href="{% url 'tournament:profile' %}">My Bot</a>" button in the navigation bar. Click the
        "<a href="{% url 'tournament:profile_edit' %}">Edit</a>" button to input a docker image ID. Once you save, your bot will
        start competing in matches against other bots.</p>

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>Congratulations. Your bot is ready to compete!</p>
    <p>It may be up to <b>10 minutes</b> before your bot has played a few matches. In the meantime, move onto <a
            href="{% url 'tournament:documentation' page_name="basics_intro" %}">Introducing Halite</a>.</p>
