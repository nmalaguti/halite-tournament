    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h2>About</h2>

    <h3>What is Halite?</h3>
    <p>Halite is a multiplayer turn-based strategy game played on a rectangular grid; the objective of the game is to take over
        the entire grid and eliminate the other players in the game.</p>

    <h3>Where does the game come from? Who invented it?</h3>
    <p>The Halite game was created by <a href="https://github.com/Sydriax">Benjamin Spector</a> and <a href="https://github.com/truell20">Michael
        Truell</a> during a summer internship at Two Sigma in 2016.</p>

    <p>The game format is inspired by the 2011 Ants AI Challenge sponsored
        by Google.</p>

    <h3>Why did they invent it?</h3>
    <p>Haliteâ€™s creators heard about the Ants AI Challenge a few years too late ðŸ˜¢</p>
    <p>They couldnâ€™t find any other competitions quite like
        it, so they decided to create one.</p>

    <h3>How are rankings computed?</h3>
    <p>Rankings are based on the outcome of organized games where bots play against each other. A good analogy is the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo rating system</a> used for chess.</p>

    <p>More precisely, rankings are
        computed using a Bayesian algorithm variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system">Glicko system</a>,
        specifically using the TrueSkill Python library available <a href="https://github.com/sublee/trueskill">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Trueskill is configured with <em>tau = 0</em>, <em>draw probability = 0</em>, <em>mu = 25</em>, and <em>sigma = 8.333</em>.
        This configuration is based on the analysis done in <a href="https://janzert.com/halite/rating-report/">A Quick Rating System Comparison</a>.</p>

    <h2>Bot Programming</h2>

    <h3>Do I need to be a programmer to play the game?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Halite is a programming competition. You need to program a bot that will play the game in the Halite tournament.<br>However, you
        definitely donâ€™t have to be a very good programmer to play Halite effectively. Success is more about coming up with a good strategy
        to play the game than coding this strategy expertly.</p>

    <h3>What languages does the game support?</h3>
    <p>Any and all! If the language can read from stdin and print to stdout, we can support it.<br>We provide out-of-the-box starter
        packages for the following languages: Python, Java and C++. See <a href="https://2016.halite.io/downloads.php">here</a> for our
        growing list of starter packages.<br>Weâ€™re counting on the community to add support for as many languages as people want. Visit <a
                href="https://2016.halite.io/advanced_writing_sp.php">this page</a> for more information on writing your own starter package
        and the protocol used by the game environment to talk to your bot.

    <h3>How do I submit my bot?</h3>
    <p>To submit your bot, you'll first need to zip your source code. Then, after signing in, click the "Submit" button on the top-right
        part of the page. Then, simply select your zipped source code to submit.</p>

    <h2>The Code behind the Tournament</h2>

    <h3>Is the code open source?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Check out the <a href="https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite">Github repo</a>.</p>
