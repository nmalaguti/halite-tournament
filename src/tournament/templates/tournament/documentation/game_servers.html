    <h1>Game Servers</h1>
    <p>Matches are run using <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources">Github
        actions x64_64 runners</a>.</p>
    <p>Each bot gets access to up to 1 GB of ram and 1/3 of a single CPU core. Be
        careful when coding your bot that you can complete all your necessary logic within the timeout with limited CPU time.</p>
    <p>Your bot will not have network access when running. If you need access to additional files, be sure to include them in your
        docker image.</p>
